		<p>I'm from Venezuela, Caracas. First of all, I'm Corporate Lawyer graduated on July 2015. 
		I wanted to change so I decided to start a creative career in advertising due to I really like all the creative things and have now the opportunity to do it. I consider that I have many creative skills that I would like to improve and develop as much as I can and learn different tools. I have been living in New York for 1 year and I choosed Miami ad School because some people recomended me as a great school to study advertising. I'm an art director and this is my third quarter. I have not experience working as an art director, I would like to do in a while an intership that could help me to learn more. My dreams or goals with this School is to learn more about advertising,to develop a good strategy for a campaign, to know about the market and how is to work with clients of this type, and can create different impacts and positive thinkings with the results of a campaign, try to change the way of people see a product, and other things. In a future, I would like to work in the industrie of music or fashion, because is the most that I like. </h2></p>
