		<p>Since I was a little girl, I have dedicated myself to music, especially singing.<br>
		I started at the age of 7 in the choir of my school and in presentations in private.<br>
		Time later, I joined Mayre Martinez's musical producer, winner of the first "Latin American Idol"<br>
		which later became the production company "Solo Tu Voz".<br>
		I had presentations at several theaters in Caracas, such as the "Centro Cultural BOD" </p></center>

		<center><p>Another of my hobbies is Flamenco dance,<br>
		I danced 10 years of which 4 were at professional level</p></center>

		<center><p>I like racket sports, I practice 2 years of tennis<br>but then I switch to squash which I practice for 7 years but I leave it because of knee problems.<br> It is a sport that aims to develop perseverance, discipline, fitness and logic</p></center>
