		<h1> Hi, I'm Mariana Mora.</h1>
	<p>I'm from Venezuela, Caracas. First of all, I'm lawyer graduated on July 2015. <br> I wanted to change so I decided to start a creative career in advertising due to I really like all the creative things and have now the opportunity to do it.<br>
	I have been living in New York for 1 year and I choosed Miami ad School because some people recomended me as a great school to study advertising. <br> 
	I'm an art director and this is my third quarter.<br>
	I would like to improve my creative skills and develop as much as I can and learn diferent tools. <br>
	I have not experience working as an art director, I would like to do in a while an intership that could help me to learn more.</p>
